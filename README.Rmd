# The MCE package <a href='https:/jack-h-laverick.github.io/MCE'><img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

MCE is an R package for modelling the vertical distribution of coral communities across depth gradients. MCE currently contains a light driven
mechanistic model of the transition from shallow to mesophotic reefs. The goal for the future is to allow the research community to include additional mechanisms. These models can provide useful null hypotheses, and help us to quantify the importance of missing ecosystem level processes.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of MCE from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Jack-H-Laverick/MCE")
```
## Usage

The functions in MCE are broadly split into environmental functions, and community preferences. By combining the spatial gradient of an environmental factor with a relationship between the factor and coral communities, we can predict community zonation for a reef.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height=1, dpi=800, warning=F }

library(ggplot2)

label <- data.frame(x = c(0, 2, 4),
                   y = c(0, 0, 0),
                   label = c("Environmental\nfactor",
                              "Community\npreferences",
                              "Vertical reef\nzones"))

cols <- c("Environmental\nfactor" = "#003366",
         "Community\npreferences" = "#CC6600",
         "Vertical reef\nzones" = "black")

text <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3),
                   y = c(0, 0),
                   label = c( "+",
                              "="))

ggplot() +
  geom_label(data = label, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label, fill = label), colour = "white", show.legend = F, label.r = unit(1, "lines"), label.padding = unit(1, "lines"), label.size = unit(5, "mm")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cols) +
  geom_text(data = text, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), colour = "gray", size = 15, fontface = "italic") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-1, 5), ylim = c(-1, 1))


```

## Future Expansion

The first version of MCE contains a simple light-relationship, including changes in water clarity and bathymetric shading. There are other enviornmental gradients and processes which could affect the vertical zonation of coral reef communities.
